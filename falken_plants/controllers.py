# Each of these operations must have its own logical function in the controllers.py file:
# - List all instances
# - Post a new instance
# - Get a specific instance
# - Put a specific instance
# - Delete a specific instance
# ...

# The CRUD operations use to return a JSON response:
# return jsonify(response)
